        about_robin_text: "My name is <strong>Robin Bortlík</strong> and I come from the <strong>%{czech_republic}</strong>.
        ezLemon is my <strong>bachelor project</strong>, which can help you to <strong>learn foreign language</strong>.<br />
        You can simply speak with someone from another country through skype or teach someone with our excercises.<br />
        And if you are not looking for someone who would learn with you? Then you can just read documents or watch videos.<br />
        The last thing I would like to say is <strong>Enjoy It</strong>.<br />
        <br />
        Special thanks to <strong>Klárka</strong>, my <strong>family</strong>,  my <strong>friends</strong> %{hubert_frey}, %{tomas_pavelka}, %{martin_hladil}, %{roman_ozana}, Ivo Slavík, Marek Polášek and companies %{railsformers}, %{omdesign}"
